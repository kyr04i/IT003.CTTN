# Experiment with sorting algorithms

> Project requirements: 
1. Create a dataset of 10 sequences, each with about 1 million real numbers (random); the first sequence is in ascending order, the second is in descending order, the remaining 8 sequences are in random order
2. Write programs to sort the array according to the QuickSort, HeapSort, MergeSort algorithms and call the C++ sort function
3. Test each of the programs written above with the generated data set, recording the execution time of each test
4. Write test report: test results in data table and chart form; comment on experimental results
5. Report submitted in PDF file
